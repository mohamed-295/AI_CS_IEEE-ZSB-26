#### AI

It's basically a try to simulate the human intelligence with matching , exceeding or less than the human abilities to learns , infer and reason.
#### ML

Here we don't need to program all edges or rules but just train the machine then it can predict what to do , it's very good at predictions and recognition also it's used in finding the outliers as it's trained on a data then can predict what's doesn't fit.

#### Deep Learning

Next we added to machine learning a multiple layers of neural networks to mimic the human brain as it allows to make more complex tasks but it can be unpredictable sometimes due to the deep layers.


#### Gen AI

Now we have the gen-ai which not only predicts but it's generates new content. It uses foundation models like LLMs as example : chatbots which generates text, audio or video.

This Foundation Models changed the curve of the AI technology almost changed the game for everything.
